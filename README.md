This is a simplified "cheat sheet" for Favicon and Touch Icons for iOS and Android. 

**What is a Favicon?**

Favicons are the small, square icons that frequently are associated with websites and show up on the title tab of the webpage. Favicons appear in many places, including browser toolbars, bookmarks, tabs, and address bars.

**Why Favicons?**

Favicons provide immediate visual identification of their represented sites, enabling super-easy navigation for Web users. While surfing bookmarks with fifty tabs open, finding and clicking on icons is far more efficient than reading through piles of link text. Yet, beyond making it easier for people to identify and locate their favorite websites, favicons also play a critical role in site branding and product recognition.
